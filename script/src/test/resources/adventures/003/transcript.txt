Welcome!
This is "test" adventure #3.

I'm in a luxurious master bedroom with a huge king-size bed.

There is a single exit to the South

I'm at the top of long flight of stairs which lead down.

There are 2 obvious exits: North, Down
> go down (go Down)

I'm looking north down a long hallway. There are stairs leading up.

I can also see a closed door

There is a single exit to the Up
> inventory (inventory)

I'm carrying a bloody knife
> open door (open door)

Okay, I opened it and am going through.
I'm outside. I've made it.

Whew! That was close. I may want to get rid of this knife.

Good idea. Okay, I dropped it.
I'm not carrying anything right now.
