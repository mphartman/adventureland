I'm in the back seat of the van. There is a front seat.

There are no obvious exits.

What should I do?
> go front seat (go front seat)

I'm in the front seat of the van. There is a back seat. There's a dash with a lot of buttons and dials.

There are no obvious exits.

The doors are locked.

What should I do?
> look dash (look dash)

I see a button with a picture of a key on it. I wonder what that does.

The doors are locked.

What should I do?
> push button (push button)

<click>

The doors are NOT locked.

What should I do?
> exit van (exit van)

Freedom!
I made it out.
